# Unit Test Findings

Bugs and issues discovered during unit test development.

## F-001: ~~`oc_list_add_block()` circular link~~ — RESOLVED

- **Status:** Moot — `oc_list_add_block()` was removed from upstream.

## F-002: ~~`oc_ri_get_interface_mask()` returns 1 for empty input instead of `OC_IF_NONE`~~ — RESOLVED

- **Status:** Moot — `oc_ri_get_interface_mask()` had no production callers (used
  only by its own unit test) and was removed, along with its `GetInterfaceMask`
  tests in `test_oc_ri.cpp`.

## F-003: ~~`oc_core_read_and_set_device_hostname()` reads up to 128 bytes into a 17-byte stack buffer~~ — RESOLVED

- **File:** `api/oc_core_res.c`, `oc_core_read_and_set_device_hostname()` (~line 113)
- **Severity:** High — stack buffer overflow / memory corruption if the stored
  hostname file is larger than `HNAME_SIZE`.
- **Found by:** Code review while writing `test_oc_core_res.cpp` (not triggered
  by a test — doing so would corrupt the stack).
- **Description:** The local buffer was `char hname[HNAME_SIZE]` where
  `HNAME_SIZE == 4 + SERIAL_NUM_SIZE + 1 == 17`. The function then called
  `oc_storage_read(KNX_STORAGE_HOSTNAME, (uint8_t *)&hname, 128)`. If a stored
  hostname file contained more than 17 bytes, `fread()` wrote up to 128 bytes
  into the 17-byte stack buffer, overflowing it.
- **Resolution:** The buffer is now `char hname[MAX_HNAME_BUFFER_SIZE]`
  (`MAX_HNAME_BUFFER_SIZE == 129`, zero-initialized) and the read is capped at
  `MAX_HNAME_BUFFER_SIZE - 1` (128). `fread()` therefore writes at most 128
  bytes into a 129-byte buffer, leaving index 128 as a guaranteed trailing `\0`.
  This eliminates both the overflow and the subsequent `strlen()` over-read on
  an unterminated buffer.

## F-004: ~~`oc_message_add_ref(NULL)` dereferences NULL in the trailing debug log~~ — RESOLVED

- **File:** `api/oc_buffer.c`, `oc_message_add_ref()` (~line 56)
- **Severity:** Low/Medium — only triggered in `OC_DEBUG` builds; the increment
  itself is correctly NULL-guarded.
- **Found by:** `test_oc_buffer.cpp` / `BufferPool.AddRefNullIsNoOp` (was SEGFAULT).
- **Description:** The function guarded the increment with `if (message)`, but the
  `OC_DBG(...)` statement that followed read `message->ref_count`
  *unconditionally*, outside the guard:

  ```c
  if (message) { message->ref_count++; }
  OC_DBG("... counter is now %d", (void*)message, message->ref_count); // NULL deref
  ```

  With `OC_DEBUG` defined (as in the test/CI build) `OC_DBG` expanded to a real
  `printf`, so passing `NULL` dereferenced a NULL pointer and crashed. In a
  release build `OC_DBG` is a no-op, masking the defect.
- **Resolution:** The `OC_DBG` is now inside the `if (message)` block (matching
  `oc_message_unref`), so `oc_message_add_ref(NULL)` is a safe no-op in all
  builds. The previously skipped test `BufferPool.AddRefNullIsNoOp` now actively
  verifies the NULL-safe behaviour.
